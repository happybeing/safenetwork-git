# SAFE Network git

`scripts/safegit.sh` is a script to help publish secure decentralised git repositories on the SAFE Network, a secure, decentralised storage and communications platform [safenetwork.tech](safenetwork.tech).

This is an interim solution but achieves the aim of a truly decentralised alternative to github and other centralised solutions. Once published, a project will be available to everyone forever as a secure immutable repository, without censorship, server downtime, or vulnerability to DDoS and other attacks.

## safegit Tutorial
A tutorial explaining how to use `safegit` to publish a git repository, and to send or receive pull requests via the SAFE Network is available here in [safegit: Decentralised Git on SAFE Network](http://dweb.happybeing.com/blog/post/002-safegit-decentralised-git-on-safe-network/)

## SAFE Command Line
To use `safegit` you must have a working SAFE Network command line installed as explained in the [SAFE CLI documentation](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe-api/tree/master/safe-cli#safe-cli). You must also be logged into a SAFE Network account for the `safegit` script to work.
